Step 3. Now after installing PostgreSQL on your Windows 10 OS, it's time to launch our app pgAdmin 4 gui. Then you need to give the password. You should give the password that you have used during the installation of your PostgreSQL on your windows 10/11 64bit os. This password you will need every time  logging in in your  postgres SQL.
