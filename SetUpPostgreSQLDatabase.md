# Set Up a PostgreSQL Database on Windows

Step 1. First You need to download PostgreSQL. For that, just follow the following link.
https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
This page will lead to the PostgreSQL download on Windows 10. So just click on download and it will start downloading automatically. 

Step 2. After downloading just double-click on the installation file for installing Postgresql on your Windows 10 OS. 64 bit. In my video, I have shown you step by step on how to install Postgresql. Just follow that if you are facing any issues. 

Step 3. Now after installing PostgreSQL on your Windows 10 OS, it's time to launch our app pgAdmin 4 gui. Then you need to give the password. You should give the password that you have used during the installation of your PostgreSQL on your windows 10/11 64bit os. 

Step 4. After your password is verified you should get to see the pgAdmin graphical user interface (GUI). So here just create a new database to check if everything is just working fine.

Step 5. After creating a new database now it's time to create a new table where we will store data. 

# Upgrading pgAdmin 4 For PostgreSQL
Starting pgAdmin 4
Click the start menu
Go to PostgreSQL
Select and click pgAdmin4
It then asks us to create a master password.
The master password is required to unlock saved passwords and reconnect to the database server(s).
Create the password, and then we're good to go.

## Upgrading pgAdmin 4
I got the case where the PostgreSQL 12 installer comes with pgAdmin 4 version 4.21 while the latest version is 4.23.
